/*
    Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
    ----------------------------------------

    In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, 
    it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new 
    string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

    Example:

    'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'

    Note:

    Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between 
    concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

    Build myStr from the strings 
    "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator.
*/

/*
    Challenge Solution
    ------------------
*/

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";

/*
    Expected Results
    ----------------
    myStr should have a value of This is the start. This is the end.
    
    You should use the + operator to build myStr.
    
    myStr should be created using the var keyword.
    
    You should assign the result to the myStr variable.
